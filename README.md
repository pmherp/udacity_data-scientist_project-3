## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The package can be installed on any local python environment with pip install .

## Project Motivation
For this project, I want to showcase how to create a python package from scratch for binomial distribution.

That's to demonstrate the benefits of object oriented programming in writing programs that include multiple classes and it's practical application to real world data science problems in any company.

Further to showcase clean, modular and well-documented code examples which greatly benefit collaboration.

You can also read [this article](https://philip-57199.medium.com/this-is-why-object-oriented-programming-is-a-must-for-data-scientists-97510b9381b) to find out more about why Data Science units should start using Object-Oriented Programming.

## File Descriptions
There are python files including all the files that are necessary to run the code. Also there is the setup file to run pip install and the init to load the distribution classes.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
I must give credit to Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree program for the code on Gaussian distribution and the Distribution class.
