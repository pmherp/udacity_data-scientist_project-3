## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The package can be installed on any local python environment with pip install .

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was using code examples from Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree programm to showcase how to create a python package from scratch for binomial distribution.

## File Descriptions
There are python files including all the classes that are necessary to run the code. Also there is the setup file to run pip install and the init to load the distribution classes.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
I must give credit to Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree for the code on Gaussian distribution.
